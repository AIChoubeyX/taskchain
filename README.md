# ðŸª™ SimpleStorage Smart Contract


---

## ðŸ“– Project Description  
**SimpleStorage** is a beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract that helps you understand the core concepts of blockchain â€” such as storing, retrieving, and updating data on-chain.  
Itâ€™s perfect for learning how smart contracts work, testing your local blockchain setup, or experimenting with Ethereum test networks.

---

## âš¡ What It Does  
The **SimpleStorage** contract allows users to:
- Store a single number on the blockchain  
- Retrieve it anytime  
- Update the number (with transaction logs)  

This simple concept forms the foundation for understanding **state variables**, **functions**, **events**, and **gas fees** in Ethereum smart contracts.
